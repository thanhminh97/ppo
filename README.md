# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** â€” a popular and effective reinforcement learning algorithm developed by OpenAI.

## What is PPO?

PPO is a policy gradient method designed to update policies reliably and efficiently. It uses a clipped surrogate objective to avoid large policy updates, making training more stable compared to earlier methods like TRPO.

## Key Features

- Stable and efficient policy optimization  
- Uses clipped objective to limit policy updates  
- Supports both discrete and continuous action spaces  
- Easy to implement and tune  

## How PPO Works

1. Collect experiences by running the current policy in the environment.  
2. Compute advantages to estimate how good each action is compared to average.  
3. Update the policy by maximizing the clipped surrogate objective:

\[
L^{\text{clip}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \; \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
\]

where  
- \( r_t(\theta) \) is the ratio of new policy probability to old policy probability,  
- \( \hat{A}_t \) is the advantage estimate,  
- \( \epsilon \) controls the clipping range.

## Usage

- This repo provides code to train PPO agents on common RL environments like OpenAI Gym.  
- You can customize hyperparameters such as learning rate, clipping epsilon, number of epochs, etc.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch  
- OpenAI Gym
